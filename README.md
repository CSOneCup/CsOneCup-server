## Introduction

**CSOneCup** is a gamified platform designed to make learning computer science (CS) knowledge both engaging and effective. By integrating CS quizzes into a fun and interactive card format, the platform aims to cater to different audiences:

- **Job Seekers**: Effortlessly prepare for technical interviews and coding tests while managing time effectively.
- **CS Students**: Build a deeper understanding of CS subjects without the stress of traditional study methods.
- **Junior Developers**: Continue professional growth while enjoying a gamified learning experience.

CSOneCup empowers users by providing them with the ability to:
- Test and validate their knowledge through quizzes.
- Focus on weak areas by targeting specific categories.
- Create custom decks to share and compete with others.

The platform turns learning into a rewarding and motivating experience through friendly competition and personalization.
